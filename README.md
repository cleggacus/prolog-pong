This was a dumb but fun project trying to create the clasic game pong in the terminal using a prolog. Prolog isn't known for games so it was a challenge to see if it could be done!

You can use w, s keys for player 1 (wasd) and k, j keys for player 2 (vim arrows).

## Run
To run teh following game in swipl write the following command
```sh
swipl ./pong.pl
```
